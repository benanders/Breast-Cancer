# Breast Cancer Malignancy Prediction

This project uses the University of Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset to predict whether a patient's breast cancer is malignant or benign. 

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is trained on data derived from 569 images of Fine Needle Aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses. The model achieves 98.83% accuracy, with 98.41% precision and 98.41% recall, on a test set of 141 patients.
